# capoeira-design-plan
This is a Design Plan for the build and development of web & mobile interfaces of a Website, its requisites, contents, main components and features.

## Description
This project is a sample of the basic documentation process, blue-prints, designs, prototypes and reference material to support the development of web and mobile interfaces of the Capoeira Website.

The documentation and specifications will describe the most relevant steps and deliverables involved in the website's development. This way, the Plan will cover relevant aspects, from conceptual definitions and requirements, going to the elaboration and construction of thumbnails, mockups and prototypes. Some elements that will take part of this Design Plan of the Capoeira Website:

* Purpose
* Audience
* Concepts & Guidelines
* Sitemap
* Thumbnails
* Wireframes
* Mockups
* Graphics
  * Web Design Process
  * Mobile Design Process
  * App icons
* Animation models
* Prototypes

Besides the conventional documentation, the Plan will also be supported by graphical tolls to produce more tangible descriptions/details about the target interfaces' requirements (Wireframe, Mockups, GIFs, PhotoShop, etc.)

## Demos & Prototypes
The Design Plan comtemplates the production of animated models and prototypes to illustrate the  interfaces' main features, functional requisites and UX aspects. The following images are animations (GIFs) exported from the original prototypes built using Adobe PhotoShop for both interface versions:
