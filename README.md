# capoeira-design-plan
This is a Design Plan for development of web & mobile interfaces of a Website, its contents, main components and features.

## Description
This project is a sample of the basic documentation, designs, prototypes and reference material to support the development of web and mobile interfaces of a website.

The resquisites and specifications will describe the most relevant steps and deliverables of a website development. This way, the Plan will cover relevant aspects, from thumbnails to prototypes. Some elements that will take part of this Design Plan:

* Purpose
* Audience
* Concepts & Guidelines
* Sitemap
* Thumnails
* Wireframes
* Mockups
* Grapphics
  * Web Design Process
  * Mobile Design Process
  * App icons
* Prototypes

Besides the conventional documentation, the Plan will also be supported by graphical tolls to produce more tangible descriptions/details about the target interfaces' requirements (Wireframe, Mockups, GIFss, PhotoShop, etc.)

## Demos & Prototypes
The Plan comtemplates the confection of animated prototypes for both interfaces. The following images are animations (GIFs) exported from the original prototypes built using Adobe PhotoShop for both interface versions:
<div style="text-align: center">
    <table style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto>
        <tr>
            <td>Web interface</td>
            <td>Mobile interface</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <img src="https://github.com/paulonegrao/capoeira-design-plan/blob/master/images/PauloNegrao_web_version.gif" alt="Web Interface" height="250px"/>
            </td>
            <td>
                <img src="https://github.com/paulonegrao/capoeira-design-plan/blob/master/images/PauloNegrao_mobile_version.gif" alt="Mobile Interface" height="500px"/>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</div>

To access a prototype version of the Web interface, click the image bellow (this prototype is hosted as a Heroku application. The app will be automatically started by Heroku in case it is not already running. In this case, the link will take some extra seconds to respond):
