# capoeira-design-plan
This is a Design Plan for development of web & mobile interfaces of a Website, its contents, main components and features.

## Description
This project is a sample of the basic documentation, designs, prototypes and reference material to support the development of web and mobile interfaces of a website.

The resquisites and specifications will describe the most relevant steps and deliverables of a website development. This way, the Plan will cover relevant aspects, from thumbnails to prototypes. Some elements that will take part of this Design Plan:

* Purpose
* Audience
* Concepts & Guidelines
* Sitemap
* Thumnails
* Wireframes
* Mockups
* Grapphics
  * Web Design Process
  * Mobile Design Process
  * App icons
* Prototypes

Besides the conventional documentation, the Plan will also be supported by graphical tolls to produce more tangible descriptions/details about about the target interfaces' requirements (Wireframe, Mockups, Gifs, PhotoShop, etc.)
